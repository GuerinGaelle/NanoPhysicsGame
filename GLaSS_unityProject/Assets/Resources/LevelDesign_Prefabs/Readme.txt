You'll find in this folder all the prefabs (things you can drag&drop in a Unity Scene) to create levels with.

/!\ Please do NOT modify the values on the prefab itself but on the instances /!\ 
(instance = the thing you dragged in the scene -> in the Hierarchy tab NOT the Project tab)

Explaination : 
If you modify the values on the prefab (in the project tab) it will take effects on all the instances 
(the things inthe Hierarchy tab) of the entire game...
If you just modify an instance, then it's ok, it's just this particular object in the scene that will be affected.

Thanks,
David
